# PreCad for Windows

## About PreCad for Windows
- PreCad is a 2DCAD that supports multi-pages.
- Supports many file formats such as dxf, jww, jwc, sfc, lcd, skc, pdf, svg, hpgl (some can only be read).
- You can use Jw_cad's line symbol transformation.
- Jw_cad parts files (*.jws) can be used as parts.
- There is also an [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.junkbulk.precad) (but it is different because the source code and development language are different)

## Others

### Running on Wine
#### Note
- The procedure described below is a record of my trial and error, and does not guarantee that it will work.
- Since gdiplus.dll is changed to the native version, other software may be affected. In that case, please return gdiplus.dll to the built-in version.
- If you don't use Japanese for drawing, I don't think you need to do anything about fonts.

#### Procedure
I confirmed booting on Ubuntu 22.04 and Wine9.0.
- Install cjk fonts with Winetricks (to prevent garbled characters in the installer. It may not be necessary in an English environment)
- Install ie8 with Winetricks (some functions cannot be used. It is not required)
- Modify the registry with the following command
```wine reg.exe ADD "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\X11 Driver" "/v" "UseXVidMode" "/t" "REG_SZ" "/d" "N"```

Now you can install it for now.
However, when I start PreCad, draw a line, and enlarge the screen, I notice that the line width is strange.
So, select Run winconfig in Winetricks and add gdiplus from the libraries inside. This will make the line width normal.
However, in the native version of gdiplus, if you do not properly specify the Japanese font, Japanese characters will be garbled (Japanese characters will also be garbled with this installer. In Windows, the characters will not be garbled because they will be displayed in an alternative font. The built-in version also doesn't seem to have garbled characters.I think you'll need to edit FontLink in the registry, but that seems difficult).
If you don't have many Japanese fonts, run `winetricks allfonts` to install them (of course, you can select and install only Japanese fonts instead of all).
However, PreCad does not embed fonts in files, so if the drawing you open uses fonts that are not installed, this can be a problem. In Windows, the text is readable because an alternative font is set, but in Wine, the text is garbled. Please specify an alternative font in PreCad option. Now you can read it.
